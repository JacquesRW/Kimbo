# Kimbo

Kimbo is a UCI compatible chess engine written in Rust. 

Move generation is handled in [kimbo_state](https://github.com/JacquesRW/kimbo_state).

See releases for a list of features.

#### TODO
- Progress through move list rather than pre-sorting
- Quiet move ordering heuristics
- Add back LMR, LMP and razoring
- Add PVS
- Add null move pruning
