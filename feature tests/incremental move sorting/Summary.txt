The performance in quiescence search is essentially random, 
some positions allow for almost no beta cutoffs, others many.

Overall performance is marginally quicker on average with the
iteration instead of pre-sorting.
Big benefit for iteration is finer control in the future for staging
move generation and more performance intensive move ordering techniques.
